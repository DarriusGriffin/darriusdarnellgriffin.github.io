<h3>About Me</h3>
 <p>I attend a school called James Campbell High School. I am 16 years old and I am now a seinor, it makes me sad to even think about it.. My birthday is on November 30, 2002 but the only thing I hate about my birthday is the fact that it is so late within the year :( all of my friends are older than me and thats not cool ;(. But anyways... I was born and raised on the island of oahu. My ethnicities include African-American, Filipino, Spanish, and Indian. If you individually count the letters in my first name, middle, and last, you'll see that you come up with 777. My parents made sure of that because of how they firmly believed that I was a gift and that I am their good luck charm. </p>
